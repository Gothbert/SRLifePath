Binary Mentality,Negative,Mental,4,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character thinks in rigid binaries and struggles with nuance.

Any time the character rolls a Matrix test and gets 2 or more 1s (even if not a glitch), an unintended consequence occurs (like triggering an alert or damaging a file they didn‚Äôt intend to).

Curiosity Killed the Cat,Negative,Mental,3,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Overwhelming curiosity. When confronted with an unknown or mysterious situation (especially in the Matrix, like a strange icon or encrypted node), the character must make a Willpower test to avoid investigating it immediately, even if it‚Äôs dangerous. Failure means they will poke around or open the file/trap despite warnings.",

Data Anomaly,Positive,Matrix,-3,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character‚Äôs data trail is strangely erratic. Matrix Perception checks to trace or identify the character‚Äôs icon suffer ‚Äì2 dice, as if something about their persona‚Äôs code doesn‚Äôt conform to expected patterns.",
Data Haven Membership,Positive,Matrix,-5,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character belongs to an exclusive data haven (secret Matrix community). This grants access to hidden forums, paydata exchanges, and off-the-grid resources. (In game terms, they might start with a useful contact in the haven and easier access to certain knowledge or illegal files.)",
Data Liberator,Negative,Social,4,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Ideological hacker who believes information should be free. The character feels compelled to release stolen data to the public rather than sell it or keep it secret.

They may also refuse runs that involve suppressing or destroying data, and prefer runs where data is exposed.",
Dead Stick,Negative,Vehicle,4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Intermittent control loss. Occasionally (especially on a glitch), the character‚Äôs vehicle controls become unresponsive (‚Äúgo dead‚Äù).

Deck Builder,Positive,Matrix,-4,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Talented at building and customizing cyberdecks. The character gains +2 dice on Hardware tests to modify or repair cyberdecks.

Defective Attribute (Matrix),Negative,Matrix,5,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"One of the character‚Äôs Matrix persona attributes is flawed (Attack, Sleaze, Data Processing, or Firewall ‚Äì choose one when taking this quality).

Driving Style: Combat Ace,Positive,Vehicle,-5,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Specialized driving style focusing on vehicular combat.

Driving Style: Getaway Driver,Positive,Vehicle,-5,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Specialized in escape and evasion driving. Halves Edge cost for maneuvers related to fleeing pursuers or losing tails.

The character can perform spectacular tricks with greater control and may receive bonuses to entertain or distract using vehicle maneuvers.",
Drone Animosity,Negative,Social,4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Drones and AIs just don‚Äôt like you. Autopilots target the character preferentially, and free drones or sprites react negatively. The character suffers a ‚Äì2 dice penalty on social tests toward AI or drone entities, and enemy drones may choose them as a primary target more often.",
Easy Mark,Negative,Social,4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,Gullible and easily conned. The character resists Con and social manipulation with ‚Äì2 dice. NPC grifters or hustlers will often single them out as a target. (The character might also have a hard time saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to sob stories or sales pitches.),
Fade to Black,Positive,Matrix,-7,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Expert at covering tracks in the Matrix. When the character logs off or crashes a host, their Overwatch Score is reduced by an additional amount (or increases more slowly). It‚Äôs much harder for GOD to pinpoint their activities; convergence is effectively delayed or requires more OS against them.",
Finesse,Negative,Mental,4,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Prefers subtlety over brute force, to a fault. The character cannot gain or spend Edge on actions that rely on brute strength or direct aggression, as such tactics unnerve them. They are compelled to use stealth or clever approaches even when not ideal.",
First Impression,Positive,Social,-11,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,Excellent at initial meetings; +2 dice on social tests when meeting someone new (only on the first encounter).,
Fractal Blast,Positive,Matrix,-5,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character‚Äôs Matrix attacks (especially technomancer complex forms or biofeedback attacks) have a chaotic fractal signature that‚Äôs hard to defend against. Once per encounter, they can force a target defending against their Matrix attack to take a ‚Äì2 dice penalty (representing the unpredictable code pattern).",Technomancer or specialized hacker
Fuzz Magnet,Negative,Social,4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Attracts law enforcement attention. Police and security seem to zero in on the character for random stops, searches, and ID checks.

Gear Acquisition Syndrome,Negative,Mental,4,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Obsessed with obtaining new gear. The character compulsively spends resources on the latest gadgets or weapons. They may have to make a Willpower test to resist purchasing new tech, often leaving them short on cash.",
Glitchy,Negative,Matrix,4,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,Personal tech prone to errors. One of the character‚Äôs important devices or cyberware pieces frequently glitches. The GM may trigger a minor glitch at inconvenient times (even on a successful roll) for that device.,
Golden Screwdriver,Positive,Matrix,-8,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Master debugger. The character gets +2 dice on tests to troubleshoot or debug Matrix systems (e.g., fixing a glitched program, clearing a virus, repairing a corrupted file).

Gremlins (Level 1-4),Negative,Matrix,3,Level,1,4,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,Technology tends to malfunction around the character. Any device they use has an increased chance to glitch or critically glitch (higher levels intensify this effect).,
Hacker Combo,Positive,Matrix,-5,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Capable of executing two Matrix actions in quick succession. Once per Combat Turn, the character may perform two Matrix actions that normally each require a Major Action, as a combined Major Action (e.g., a hack followed immediately by editing data). The second action might receive a +1 Threshold or ‚Äì2 dice (since combo actions are tricky), but it allows complex hacking sequences in one go.",
Hold the Door,Positive,Matrix,-6,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Specialist in holding open or preventing system shutdowns. If a host is trying to expel the character or go on lockdown, the character gains +2 dice to resist it and can extend the time before a forced log-off or door lock closes by one round. (In Matrix terms, they keep an access node open longer for teammates to escape or enter.)",
Honorbound (Code of Honor),Negative,Mental,10,Once,0,0,Firing Squad,"The character adheres to a strict personal code (defined with the GM ‚Äì e.g. never harm innocents, always keep one‚Äôs word). They must act according to this code at all times. Breaking it is extraordinarily difficult (likely requiring spending Edge or a Willpower (very high) test) and would result in intense personal guilt and possibly gamemaster-imposed consequences.",
Hooder,Negative,Social,4,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Robin Hood syndrome: the character feels compelled to aid the downtrodden, even at personal cost. They often give away a portion of earnings to help others or refuse runs that go against their moral code. (Similar to a mild Code of Honor focused on helping the poor.)",
Hunted,Negative,Social,6,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,A particular individual or organization is actively hunting the character.

Impenetrable Logic,Positive,Matrix,-8,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character‚Äôs logic (or Firewall coding) is extremely strong. When resisting Matrix actions targeting their devices or persona (like resisting a hack or data spike), they gain +2 dice on defense if the test is linked to Logic. Additionally, if using a cyberdeck, their Firewall counts as 1 higher for determining if a hacker gets a mark on them.",

Indecisive,Negative,Mental,4,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,Difficulty making decisions under pressure. The character may lose initiative or waste actions second-guessing. (GM might enforce an initiative score reduction or require extra Minor Actions before the character chooses a course in combat.),
Injury Prone,Negative,Physical,4,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"The character tends to get hurt more often or severely.

Jack Jockey,Positive,Matrix,-5,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Expert at direct connections. The character can jack into devices quickly and effectively.

Killer,Negative,Mental,6,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Whether by reputation or inclination, the character is known as a killer. They may take a psychological compulsion to use lethal force (Willpower test to use non-lethal options), and suffer social stigma ‚Äì law enforcement and shadows alike treat them as particularly dangerous.",
Like a Boss,Negative,Social,4,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character has a need to show off and be in charge, often at inappropriate times. They might try to one-up allies or make grandiose displays that draw attention. In stealth situations, they have to make a Willpower test to avoid a flashy move or quip that could blow cover. Socially, their ego can rub people wrong ‚Äì +2 TN on Etiquette tests in formal or subordinate roles (they don‚Äôt ‚Äúknow their place‚Äù).",
Limited Attributes,Negative,Physical,8,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,One of the character‚Äôs attributes has a reduced maximum. (Specify the attribute when taking this quality.) The chosen attribute‚Äôs natural and augmented limits are each 1 point lower than normal for the character‚Äôs metatype.,
Limited Skills,Negative,Mental,8,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"The character has a cap on certain skills. (Pick a skill category or group when taken.) Skills in that group cannot exceed a certain rating (e.g., cannot raise above 3 at chargen or above 6 overall), reflecting a ceiling on their talent in that area.",

Mode Lock,Negative,Matrix,3,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character is effectively ‚Äúlocked‚Äù into one mode of Matrix interaction. Choose one: *AR-Only:* They cannot go full VR (or suffer extreme penalties if they try). *VR-Only:* They can‚Äôt effectively operate in AR ‚Äì they must be in hot-sim to do anything useful (maybe due to BTL addiction). In their non-preferred mode, they take ‚Äì4 on all Matrix actions.",
Momentous Misfortune,Negative,Mental,8,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"If something can go wrong, it will ‚Äì especially at a dramatic moment.

Possession Tradition,Negative,Magic,10,Once,0,0,Street Wyrd,The conjurer‚Äôs tradition only allows spirits to possess rather than materialize.

Pusillanimous Summoner,Negative,Magic,8,Once,0,0,Street Wyrd,"Cowardly summoner. Whenever the character summons a spirit, they are so in awe (or fear) that the spirit tries to twist their words. Spirits the character conjures will follow commands only to the letter (or less). To avoid loopholes, the summoner must first spend time (Conjuring + Intuition [8, 5 min] Extended Test) carefully wording their orders.",Conjurers (characters with Summoning) only
Quick Config,Positive,Matrix,-4,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,The character can reconfigure their cyberdeck on the fly with ease. Switching the allocation of cyberdeck attributes or swapping out a program is a Minor Action (instead of Major). This allows them to adapt their deck setup in the middle of a Matrix encounter without wasting significant time.,
Quick Healer,Positive,Physical,-3,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,Heals more quickly than normal; +2 dice on Healing tests made on or by the character.,
Relentless Tracker,Positive,Mental,-6,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Unyielding focus on a chosen goal or target.

They can choose a new goal once the previous one is achieved.",
Remote Pilot,Negative,Vehicle,4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Over-reliance on remote operation. The character has difficulty when directly controlling vehicles (meat space driving) ‚Äì they prefer jumped-in or Rigged control. They suffer ‚Äì2 dice on manual Piloting tests when not jumped in. Conversely, if they normally drive in person, they might have trouble when Rigger-jumped (apply penalty in that case, depending on character‚Äôs usual mode).",
Representation I,Negative,Magic,5,Once,0,0,Street Wyrd,"The magician requires a clear gesture, chant, or special garb to perform magic (chosen when taking this quality). **Level I:** If they cannot use their chosen representation, they suffer ‚Äì4 dice on all Magic tests. **Level II:** They cannot use magic at all without the representation. Using the representation (when available) grants +1 Edge (once per day) on a Magic test. The obvious ritual also makes them an obvious target to enemies.",Magicians only (Adepts cannot take)
Representation II,Negative,Magic,8,Once,0,0,Street Wyrd,"The magician requires a clear gesture, chant, or special garb to perform magic (chosen when taking this quality). **Level I:** If they cannot use their chosen representation, they suffer ‚Äì4 dice on all Magic tests. **Level II:** They cannot use magic at all without the representation.

Resonance Burn,Negative,Matrix,8,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Technomancer only. The character‚Äôs Resonance has been scarred (perhaps by dissonant feedback or a dangerous echo). Their Resonance attribute maximum is permanently reduced by 1 (and their current Resonance is reduced accordingly), **or** they suffer +2 DV from Fading on all Complex Forms (GM‚Äôs choice or as defined in the quality). Additionally, certain Resonance actions might cause them pain (e.g., taking 1 Stun when compiling a sprite).",This quality is only for Technomancers (Emerged)
Reverberant,Positive,Matrix,-8,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"A technomancer with a unique Resonance attunement (possibly bordering on Dissonance). This quality might grant access to a specific echo or a bonus when resisting Dissonance-based effects. For example, the character might take 2 less DV from fading when threading certain complex forms, or gain an intuitive sense when Dissonant entities are nearby. *(Exact effect of this quality is defined in context ‚Äì it represents a deep, unusual Resonance trait.)*",Technomancer only (Emerged)
Road Rage,Negative,Mental,4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Anger issues behind the wheel. When driving and provoked (someone cuts them off, traffic jam, an enemy escapes), the character must make a Willpower test to avoid flying into a rage. Failing means they engage in aggressive driving or chase behavior even if it endangers the mission or themselves.",
Rote Alchemist,Positive,Magic,-6,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Extensive practice with alchemical formulas. The character can prepare a specific alchemical formula faster or with fewer materials, or even memorize one formula for quick creation without a recipe.",Alchemy skill
Satisfaction,Positive,Matrix,-5,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character gains personal satisfaction from successful hacks, fueling their focus. After succeeding at a significant Matrix feat (like successfully extracting paydata or beating a challenging host), they regain 1 spent Edge (once per run) due to the confidence boost. Essentially, their morale and sharpness improve when they pull off a big hack.",
Sensitive System,Negative,Physical,12,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,Body rejects cyberware/bioware; Essence cost of any implant is doubled for this character.,Characters with cyberware or bioware
Shamanic Mask,Positive,Magic,-4,Once,0,0,Street Wyrd,"When using magic, the character manifests a visible aura or feature related to their mentor spirit/totem (e.g., a ghostly animal mask or elemental effect). By taking a Minor Action while using a Magical skill or power, they gain +1 Edge on that test. Drawback: the mask makes it obvious who the mage is, potentially drawing enemy fire (‚Äúshoot the mage first‚Äù).",Awakened characters only (Magician or Adept)
Signature Maneuver,Positive,Vehicle,-5,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"The character has a trademark vehicular stunt or maneuver they‚Äôve perfected. When performing their signature move (defined when taking this quality), they gain a significant bonus ‚Äì such as +2 dice or a free Edge ‚Äì because it‚Äôs second nature to them.",
Silver Lining,Positive,Matrix,-4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Even when things go wrong, the character manages to find a small benefit. When the character glitches (but doesn‚Äôt critically glitch) on a test, they gain a minor consolation ‚Äì e.g. +1 Edge or a clue from the GM ‚Äì as a ‚Äúsilver lining‚Äù to the failure.",
Simsense Dependency,Negative,Mental,4,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Hooked on the full sensory experience of simsense. The character must regularly immerse in VR or BTLs. If they go more than 24 hours without a hot-sim experience, they suffer ‚Äì1 to all actions (increasing by 1 each additional day, up to ‚Äì3) due to craving/withdrawal. They will prioritize getting their ‚Äúfix‚Äù over some obligations, which can complicate runs.",
Simsense Vertigo,Negative,Matrix,5,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,Character becomes disoriented or nauseated when using VR/simsense. They suffer penalties on Matrix actions in VR and may need to make Willpower tests to avoid disconnecting.,

SINner (National),Negative,Social,5,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,"Character has a valid national SIN (System Identification Number). They are in official databases, which can make it easier for authorities or corporations to track and find them.",
Sloppy Coder,Negative,Matrix,4,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character writes inefficient, messy code. Any program or sprite they compile has a quirk: reduce its effective rating by 1 for determining results, or it carries a bug that the GM can invoke once per session (like temporarily crashing or doing something unintended). Opponents trying to exploit the character‚Äôs self-made code gain +1 on their tests.",
Software Optimization,Positive,Matrix,-8,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Tweaks code for peak performance. One of the character‚Äôs self-written or customized programs (or agents) runs at improved efficiency, granting a bonus (e.g. +1 rating or lower chance of glitching).",
Soothing Static,Positive,Matrix,-6,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Technomancer can quell digital noise. Reduces the Noise rating by a certain amount in the character‚Äôs vicinity or when threading complex forms, making actions easier in high-noise areas.",Technomancer only
Sore Thumb,Negative,Social,4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Stands out in a crowd (or on the grid).

Enemies receive +2 on Perception or Matrix checks to single out the character‚Äôs vehicle or icon among others.",
Specialist,Negative,Mental,4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Over-specialized at the expense of general ability. The character excels only in a narrow field.

Speed Racer,Positive,Vehicle,-6,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,Lives for high-speed driving. The character gains +2 dice on tests to control a vehicle at high speeds and +1 Edge when pushing a vehicle to its top speed. They can handle breakneck velocity maneuvers with greater stability than most drivers.,

Spirit Affinity (Type),Positive,Magic,-7,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,"A particular spirit type favors the character; +2 dice on tests to summon or bind that spirit type, and spirits of that type are more well-disposed.",
Stim Patch Allergy,Negative,Physical,3,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,Allergic reaction to stimulant patches. Using a stim patch (or similar combat drug patch) on the character causes adverse effects (damage or severe side effects) instead of the normal benefits. They must rely on other means to recover from stun or fatigue.,
Surgical Strike,Positive,Matrix,-6,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character‚Äôs Matrix attacks are precise and minimize collateral damage. When performing a Data Spike or other offensive Matrix action, they can choose to do so ‚Äúsurgically,‚Äù imposing a ‚Äì2 dice penalty on themselves *but* causing their attack to not trigger any active alert if it fails. In addition, when targeting a specific device function or sub-system, they ignore 1 point of target‚Äôs Firewall (their strikes hit the weak spot).",
Target Fixation,Negative,Mental,4,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Tends to lock onto a single target in combat to the exclusion of other threats.

They must make a Willpower test to break off pursuit of a designated target, even when it‚Äôs prudent to do so.",
Team Player,Positive,Social,-11,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,Excellent at assisting allies. The character can use a Major Action to make a Leadership + Charisma test to assist a teammate‚Äôs test; either the helper or the assisted ally (player‚Äôs choice) gains +1 Edge from this teamwork.,
Teflon Coated,Positive,Social,-8,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Hard to pin blame on. The character tends to avoid the consequences of their actions; evidence and accusations just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt stick.‚Äù (Mechanically, others receive penalties on tests to trace or place blame on the character for wrongdoing.)",
The Motorpool,Positive,Vehicle,-8,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,Access to a collection of vehicles. The character effectively has a ‚Äúfleet‚Äù or easy access to multiple vehicles. They might maintain extra vehicles without lifestyle cost or call upon a network to borrow a specific ride for a job. (GM and player determine exact benefits.),
Toughness,Positive,Physical,-3,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,Physically resilient; gains a bonus die on Body tests to resist damage.,
Toxin Susceptibility (Specific),Negative,Physical,4,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,Especially vulnerable to a certain toxin or drug (specified upon taking this quality). The character suffers ‚Äì2 dice to resist that substance and its effects last longer or hit harder than normal.,
Trust Issues,Negative,Mental,10,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,"Burned by betrayal too often. The character cannot gain or spend Edge from teamwork tests (they never fully trust allies). They also suffer a penalty on Leadership or assist actions when others try to help them, due to their constant suspicion.",
Twitchy,Negative,Mental,4,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Companion,Jumpy and on-edge. The character is easily startled and may overreact to surprises. They might automatically enter combat rounds when surprised and suffer ‚Äì1 to initiative as they are constantly tense and jittery.,

Underdog,Positive,Vehicle,-6,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"Excels when outmatched in vehicle chases.

Uneducated,Negative,Mental,8,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,"Lacks basic education. Cannot default on technical, academic, or knowledge skills and must spend double Karma to learn or improve them. The character is ignorant of many common facts.",
Vehicle Empathy (Pilot Spec),Positive,Vehicle,-5,Once,0,0,Double Clutch,"The character has an intuitive connection with a particular class of vehicles (choose one specialization: e.g., Groundcraft, Aircraft, Drones, etc.). They receive +2 dice on Pilot tests with that type of vehicle and +1 Edge on tests when truly pushing that vehicle to its limits.",
Voider of Warranties,Positive,Matrix,-4,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"The character isn‚Äôt afraid to push hardware beyond recommended settings. They can overclock or jury-rig devices for short-term gains. Once per session, they may boost a device‚Äôs rating by +1 (or add a function it normally couldn‚Äôt do) for a few Combat Turns, but there‚Äôs a chance the device takes damage afterward. (This quality implies the character often voids manufacturers‚Äô warranties by tinkering, but usually with positive results.)",
Wanted by GOD,Negative,Matrix,10,Once,0,0,Hack & Slash,"Grid Overwatch Division has flagged the character as a prime target. The character‚Äôs Overwatch Score accumulates +50% faster than normal (round up) whenever they perform illegal Matrix actions. Additionally, when GOD converges on them, it may respond with higher force (more IC or rapid forensic traces). Essentially, the character is on a most-wanted list in the Matrix, and even minor hacking can bring the hammer down quickly.",
Weak Immune System,Negative,Physical,10,Once,0,0,Shadowrun Sixth World Core Rulebook,Poor resistance to disease and infection; ‚Äì2 dice on tests to resist pathogens and toxins. The character falls ill more easily and takes longer to recover.,
